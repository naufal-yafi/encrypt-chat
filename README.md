<br />
<br />
<p>Learning the basics of data security is encrypting a message</p>
<br />
* BUG :
  1. The use of passwords 25 and 87 causes lowercase letters to become capital letters and converts "K" into spaces
  2. The use of passwords 88-99 resulted in capital letters not being able to encrypt
  3. The use of passwords 87-99 resulted in spaces not being encrypted
